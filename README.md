# Fridgey_foodtracker

This app is useful for people who find themselves throwing away food they didn't eat on time, wasting food and money,
for people with time on their hands who don't have time to think about all the details of dinner and need help getting organized in the kitchen.

The app works like this:
When the user comes in from shopping and puts the food in the fridge,
they log into the app and enter the following data: the food they bought and where they stored it.
This way, the app can notify you in time to consume these foods, helping you to get rid of the worry: What am I eating tonight?

That would be the main purpose of the app. As I work on it, I will most likely add other features.
